% the\ includeonly command is very useful when working on one
% particular chapter, because it decreases compilation time.

% so you don't lose that information, but your output file contains
% only the titlepage, ToC, and the included chapter(s).

% if you use an abbreviation containing a dot and you don't
% want it to look like a period, you can use \ to stop the creation
% of extra space (As if it were the end of the sentence),

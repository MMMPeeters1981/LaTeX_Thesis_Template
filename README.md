# LaTeX_Thesis_Template
A LaTeX template for PhD theses

For anyone struggling to write their PhD thesis using LaTeX, I am sharing my template, free to use, Thesis template (LaTeX). 
The template is compiled by the main file: main-thesis.tex. The other source files are the sections that serve as input to 
the main file, the bibliography (a BiBTeX file), and a class file containing all the layout specifications. I added comments 
in the LaTeX documents to explain the details.
